# 01 Improving Horiseon Website's Accesibility

## Code Refactoring using HTML CSS Git
 
Welsome to my first assigment for the Front-End Development Bootcamp by Trilody and edX. This week's challenge is an on-the-job ticket, which meaning i began with a starter code that i needed to modify to boost Horiseon Website's **accessibility**. 
 
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this challenge, a marketing agency has hired me to refactor the Horiseon Website to make it more accessible. 
 
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
 
Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, my tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

For the Horiseon Website to meet accessibility standards, I had to complete the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Resources I used:

* [Semantic HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)
* [Image `alt` attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_alt.asp)
* [CSS Redundancy Checker](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/20su/resources/assets/css-redundancy-checker/index.html)
* [Chrome Screen Reader Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en)
* [What On Earth Is Semantic Markup? (And Why Should You Learn To Write It)](https://html.com/semantic-markup/)
* [Refactoring CSS](https://medium.com/inktrap/refactoring-css-61ef64601ebb)
* [How to Refactor CSS â€“ A Guide](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/code-optimization-series-refactoring-css/)
* [Refactoring CSS: Introduction](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/07/refactoring-css-introduction-part1/)

### Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](01-html-css-git-challenge-demo.png)

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. 

**Important**: An important rule i had to follow when working with someone else's code is the **Scout Rule**, which recommends that you always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

To impress this client, i Went the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, I made sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, i reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Are you ready to find out more? Here are the challenge requirements:

## What Have I Learned?

This was my first ever experience with coding and code refactoring and i absolutely loved it. The Slack channel we use for this bootcamp is very helpful and i remember reading my all my colleagues' questions and answers. A few of them were almost as confused as me about this challenge in the beginning. A few days ago i couldn't even understand 90% of their questions. I thought i'll never make it.

But i learned that you just have to take it step by step: 
* Firstly: read all the helpful materials and articles about the task at hand, in this case - accessibility. 
* Secondly: The theory is very easy to grasp, but when you try to apply it, sometimes i doesn't just go according to the plan - for instance i tried to elimiate 3 classes, and messed up the structure of the entire website. I panicked. Luckily i remebered there's "undo" aka CTRL+Z which is now my bff, so i went on experimenting. I was reading a blog post, then tried the ideas in my code. If it worked, fine, if it didn't - undo :). 

Now according to the Screen Reader, the accesibility is of either 90% or 100%. So i guess it's alright. 

Oh, and now i understand all the questions my colleagues asked because i've just spent so much time on this code. The more you read it, the more you notice what you need to change. It's absolutely brilliant. And you don't need to be Einstein. You just need to read carefully, be brave, and follow the logic. It's that simple. 

This being said, i hope you  like my project and stay tuned for the next challenges. I can't wait! 

Happy coding,
